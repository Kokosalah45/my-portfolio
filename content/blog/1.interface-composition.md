## What is Interface Composition

- Interface Compositions allows us to add different functionalities with ease
- Interface by convention end with “er” and this is actually has a reason behind it

If i have a cooker interface

```go
type Cooker interface {
 Grill()
 Fry()
 Saute()
 Pastry()
 Roast()
}
```

The “er” implies that anyone that has those 3 methods is considered to be a COOKER or has the traits of a cooker
However what if that Cooker only has to work on the Grilling Station or the Sauce Station
why should i add all that functionality in the Cooker interface maybe he can work at 3 stations
or all of them however not always all of them all i’m really sure of that he must work at one station
of all the stations
And here Comes Interface Compostition

```go
type Saucier interface {
 Saute(name string) bool
}
type Griller interface {
 Grill(name string) bool
}
type Fryer interface {
 Fry(name string) bool
}
type Patisserie interface{
 Bake(name string) bool
}
type Roaster interface{
 Roast(name string) bool
}
```

no let’s imagine that we want a chef that will handle the grilling station and the frying station

we can do this :

```go
type FryerGriller interface {
 Griller
 Fryer
}
```

and this is called composition → FryerGriler Chef is a person who can Fry and Grill !!

```go
func fryingStation(f Fryer){
 f.Fry()
}

func grillingStation(g Griller){
 g.Grill()
}

func fryAndGrillAtTheSameTime(fg FryerGriller){
  //concept of channels is not covered here however imagine that they are
  // happening in parallel
  fryingStation(fg)
  grillingStation(fg)
  // will work as fg is both a Fryer type and Griller Type
}
```
