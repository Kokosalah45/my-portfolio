## What is CTE

- A [common table expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_and_recursive_queries_in_SQL#Common_table_expression "Hierarchical and recursive queries in SQL - Wikipedia"), or CTE, is a temporary named result set created from a simple SQL statement that can be used in subsequent `SELECT`, `DELETE`, `INSERT`, or `UPDATE` statements.
- CTE can be used instead of sub-queries for more readable code.
- The output of CTE can be reused, as its result is saved, which is better than a sub-query that gets recomputed every time.
- KNOWING SUB-QUERIES is a must for understanding CTES, as it's a way to make your sub-query reusable, making your overall query faster and more readable.

## When to Use CTEs

CTEs allow you to perform **multi-level aggregations**. Usually when you want to perform multi-level aggregations your go to is a **SUB-QUERY**  however it's hard for your brain to parse what is going on specially when the query is way too large

---
## Types of CTEs

- Standard CTEs ( We will cover this kind of CTEs in this article )
- Recursive CTEs

## Example Problems

I have 3 tables : 
- students table => Students( id, first_name, last_name )
- subjects table => Subjects( id, subject_name )
- exams => Exams( id, exam_date, subject_id, student_id )

### 1st Task /  Exceptional Average: 

```
Calculate the average grade for the students. Then for every student with the average grade above 8.5, you need to show their first name, last name, and their average grade, and label them as “exceptional” students
```

**How to solve** :

1. **Calculate Average Grade:**
    - Join the Students and Exams tables to associate students with their grades.
    - Use the `AVG` function to calculate the average grade for each student.
    - Group the results by student ID, first name, and last name.
2. **Filter Exceptional Students:**
    - Create a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `grade_average` to store the results of the average grade calculation.
    - Select students from the CTE where the average grade is greater than 8.5.
    - Include columns for first name, last name, average grade, and label them as "exceptional."

IMPORTANT NOTE : Can be Done with a simple HAVING clause 
#### Solving using a sub-query:

```SQL
SELECT  first_name,
        last_name,
        average_grade,
        'exceptional' AS tag
FROM (
    SELECT  s.first_name,
            s.last_name,
            AVG(e.grade) AS average_grade
    FROM students s
    JOIN exams e ON s.id = e.student_id
    GROUP BY s.first_name, s.last_name
) AS grade_average
WHERE average_grade > 8.5;
```

#### Solving using a CTE :

```SQL
WITH grade_average AS ( 
SELECT  s.id, 
		s.first_name, 
		s.last_name, 
		AVG(e.grade) AS average_grade 
	FROM students s 
	JOIN exams e ON s.id = e.student_id 
	GROUP BY s.id, s.first_name, s.last_name 
)

SELECT  first_name, 
		last_name, 
		average_grade, 
		'exceptional' AS tag 
FROM grade_average 
WHERE average_grade > 8.5;
```

### 2nd Task /  Subjects with Average and Minimum Grades (Everyone Passed):

```
show the name of the subjects and their respective average and minimum grades, but only for those subjects in which everybody passed the exam, i.e. their mark is 5 or above.
```

**Steps to Solve:** 

1. **Average Calculation:**
    - Join the Subjects and Exams tables to get the grades for each subject.
    - Calculate the average grade for each subject using the `AVG` function.
    - Group the results by subject.
2. **Minimum Grade Calculation:**
    - Join the Subjects and Exams tables again to get the grades for each subject.
    - Calculate the minimum grade for each subject using the `MIN` function.
    - Use the `HAVING` clause to filter subjects where the minimum grade is greater than 5.
3. **Final Output:**
    - Join the results of the average and minimum grade calculations based on subject ID.
    - Select the subject ID, subject name, average grade, and minimum grade for subjects where everyone passed (minimum grade > 5).
    
#### Solving with a sub-query:

```SQL
SELECT  sa.id,
        sa.subject_name,
        sa.subject_average_grade
FROM (
    SELECT  su.id,
            su.subject_name,
            AVG(e.grade) AS subject_average_grade
    FROM subjects su
    JOIN exams e ON su.id = e.subject_id
    GROUP BY su.id, su.subject_name
) AS subject_average sa
JOIN (
    SELECT  su.id,
            su.subject_name,
            MIN(e.grade) AS subject_min_grade
    FROM subjects su
    JOIN exams e ON su.id = e.subject_id
    GROUP BY su.id, su.subject_name
    HAVING MIN(e.grade) > 5
) AS min_grade m ON sa.id = m.id;
```
#### Solving using a CTE :

```SQL
WITH subject_average AS ( 
SELECT su.id, 
su.subject_name, 
	AVG (e.grade) AS subject_average_grade 
FROM subjects su JOIN exams e ON su.id = e.subject_id 
GROUP BY su.id, su.subject_name 
),

min_grade AS (
SELECT su.id, 
su.subject_name, 
	MIN (e.grade) AS subject_min_grade 
FROM subjects su JOIN exams e ON su.id = e.subject_id 
GROUP BY su.id, su.subject_name 
HAVING MIN (e.grade) > 5 
)

SELECT sa.id, 
sa.subject_name, 
sa.subject_average_grade 
FROM subject_average sa 
JOIN min_grade m ON sa.id =m.id;
```

### 3rd Task / Subject-wise Avg Min and Max Grades Calculation:

**How To Solve:**

1. **Min and Max Grade Calculation:**
    
    - Join the Subjects and Exams tables to get the grades for each subject.
    - Calculate the minimum and maximum grades for each subject using the `MIN` and `MAX` functions.
    - Group the results by subject.
2. **Average Calculation:**
    
    - Calculate the average of the minimum and maximum grades using the `AVG` function.
#### Solving with a sub-query:

```SQL
SELECT      
		AVG (min_grade) AS avg_min_grade,
        AVG (max_grade) AS avg_max_grade
FROM (
SELECT  su.id,
        su.subject_name,
        MIN (e.grade) AS min_grade,
        MAX (e.grade) AS max_grade
    FROM subjects su JOIN exams e ON su.id = e.subject_id
    GROUP BY su.id, su.subject_name
) AS min_max;
```

#### Solving with a CTE:

```SQL
WITH min_max_grade AS (
SELECT      su.id,
        MIN (e.grade) AS min_grade,
        MAX (e.grade) AS max_grade
FROM subjects su JOIN exams e ON su.id = e.subject_id
GROUP BY su.id, su.subject_name
)
 
SELECT   
		AVG (min_grade) AS avg_min_grade,
        AVG (max_grade) AS avg_max_grade
FROM min_max_grade;
```

### Conclusion :  Benefits of CTEs

1. Improved Readability: By separating complex logic into smaller pieces, your query becomes more readable and easier to comprehend.

2. Code Re usability: If you need to use the same intermediate result in multiple places within your query, you can refer to the CTE instead of rewriting the logic.

3. Debugging and Maintenance: CTEs allow you to focus on one part of the problem at a time. This makes debugging and maintaining your code simpler.
