# Stored Procedures vs. Functions

Let's start by stating that **while you can write similar logic in both a stored procedure and a function and make the function return void**, this is considered bad practice according to the SQL standard. The differences between stored procedures and functions are important to understand:

### Example of the Bad Practice (Specific for PostgreSQL)

- **Stored Procedure Code**:

    ```postgreSQL
    CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE log_employee_activity(emp_id INTEGER, action TEXT)
    AS $$
    BEGIN
        INSERT INTO employee_activity_log(emp_id, action, log_time)
        VALUES (emp_id, action, now());
    END;
    $$ LANGUAGE PLPGSQL;

    CALL log_employee_activity(1, 'Updated address');  
    ```

- **Function Code**:

    ```postgreSQL
    CREATE FUNCTION OR REPLACE log_employee_activity(emp_id INTEGER, action TEXT)
    RETURNS VOID
    AS $$
    BEGIN
        INSERT INTO employee_activity_log(emp_id, action, log_time)
        VALUES (emp_id, action, now());
    END;
    $$ LANGUAGE PLPGSQL;

    SELECT log_employee_activity(1, 'Updated address');  
    ```

### Differences

1. **Return Value**:
    - **Stored Procedures**: Do not return a value. They can return multiple values through output parameters or manipulate data in the database.
    - **Functions**: Must return a value (either a scalar value, a table, or a complex data type). They are designed to produce an output that can be used in SQL expressions.

2. **Transaction Control**:
    - **Stored Procedures**: Allow for explicit transaction control with statements such as `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK`. This enables them to manage transactions directly within the procedure.
    - **Functions**: Do not support explicit transaction control.

3. **Invocation**:
    - **Stored Procedures**: Are invoked using the `CALL` statement.
    - **Functions**: Are invoked within SQL expressions, such as in `SELECT` statements, or as part of a `WHERE` clause.

4. **Execution**:
    - **Stored Procedures**: Are precompiled. This means that they are cached, which can lead to performance benefits, especially for complex queries and operations. However, execution plans for functions are also cached.
    - **Functions**: These are evaluated at runtime. This means they are always recomputed for every call, which can affect performance depending on their complexity and usage. This is a myth; see the notes below for clarification.

5. **Use Case**:
    - **Stored Procedures**: These are typically used for tasks involving multiple steps, complex business logic, or data manipulation affecting multiple tables or rows.
    - **Functions**: These are used for computations, data retrieval, and operations expected to return a single result or a table. They encapsulate reusable logic that can be utilized within queries.

6. **Side Effects**:
    - **Stored Procedures**: Can have side effects, such as modifying the database state (inserting, updating, deleting records).
    - **Functions**: These are generally designed to be side-effect-free, ensuring that the same input always produces the same output without altering the database state.

## Functions

Functions in SQL are routines that encapsulate reusable logic. They can perform calculations, data manipulations, or other operations, and return a result. Functions can be invoked directly within SQL queries, used in expressions, or even within other functions or stored procedures.

Functions are general-purpose and may contain SQL statements or simple business logic, such as checking if a number is even or odd:

```postgreSQL
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION is_even(num INTEGER)
RETURNS BOOLEAN
AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN num % 2 = 0;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE PLPGSQL;
```

Functions in SQL can return various types of values, depending on the database system and its specific capabilities. Here's an overview of common return types with examples using PostgreSQL syntax, which supports a wide range of return types:

### 1. Scalar Value

```postgreSQL
-- Function returning a single scalar value (integer)
CREATE FUNCTION get_product_count()
RETURNS INTEGER
AS $$
DECLARE
    total_count INTEGER;
BEGIN
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO total_count FROM products;
    RETURN total_count;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE PLPGSQL;

-- Usage:
SELECT get_product_count();  -- Returns the count of products as an integer
```

### 2. Table (Table-Valued Function)

```postgreSQL
-- Function returning a table (table-valued function)
CREATE FUNCTION get_products_in_category(category_id INTEGER)
RETURNS TABLE (product_id INTEGER, product_name TEXT)
AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN QUERY SELECT id, name FROM products WHERE category_id = $1;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE PLPGSQL;

-- Usage:
SELECT * FROM get_products_in_category(1);  -- Returns products in category 1 as a table
```

### 3. Composite Type

```postgreSQL
-- Example table and composite type
CREATE TABLE employee (
    emp_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name TEXT,
    emp_address TEXT
);

-- Create a composite type based on the table structure
CREATE TYPE employee_info AS (
    emp_id INTEGER,
    emp_name TEXT,
    emp_address TEXT
);

-- Function returning a composite type
CREATE FUNCTION get_employee_info(emp_id INTEGER)
RETURNS employee_info
AS $$
DECLARE
    emp_info employee_info;
BEGIN
    SELECT (emp_id, emp_name, emp_address) INTO emp_info
    FROM employee
    WHERE emp_id = $1;
    RETURN emp_info;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE PLPGSQL;

-- Usage:
SELECT * FROM get_employee_info(1);  -- Returns employee information as a composite type
```

### 4. JSON or JSONB

```postgreSQL
-- Function returning JSON or JSONB data
CREATE FUNCTION get_employee_json(emp_id INTEGER)
RETURNS JSONB
AS $$
DECLARE
    emp_json JSONB;
BEGIN
    SELECT jsonb_build_object(
        'emp_id', emp_id,
        'emp_name', emp_name,
        'emp_address', emp_address
    ) INTO emp_json
    FROM employee
    WHERE emp_id = $1;
    RETURN emp_json;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE PLPGSQL;

-- Usage:
SELECT get_employee_json(1);  -- Returns employee information as JSON or JSONB
```

### 5. Custom Data Type

```postgreSQL
-- Example of a custom data type
CREATE TYPE employee_details AS (
    emp_id INTEGER,
    emp_name TEXT,
    emp_address TEXT,
    emp_salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

-- Function returning a custom data type
CREATE FUNCTION get_employee_details(emp_id INTEGER)
RETURNS employee_details
AS $$
DECLARE
    emp_det employee_details;
BEGIN
    SELECT (emp_id, emp_name, emp_address, emp_salary) INTO emp_det
    FROM employees
    WHERE emp_id = $1;
    RETURN emp_det;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE PLPGSQL;

-- Usage:
SELECT * FROM get_employee_details(1);  -- Returns employee details as a custom data type
```

### 6. Void (Procedures) (Specific for PostgreSQL)

In some database systems, functions can be defined to return `VOID`, indicating that they do not return any value. This is often used for procedures or functions that perform actions without producing a result set.

```postgreSQL
-- Function returning void (no return value)
CREATE FUNCTION log_employee_activity(emp_id INTEGER, action TEXT)
RETURNS VOID
AS $$
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO employee_activity_log(emp_id, action, log_time)
    VALUES (emp_id, action, now());
END;
$$ LANGUAGE PLPGSQL;

-- Usage:
SELECT log_employee_activity(1, 'Updated address');  -- Logs an employee activity without returning a value
```

### 7. Triggers and Trigger Functions

In SQL, a trigger is a special type of database object that automatically executes a set of actions when certain events occur on a table or view. These events include `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `TRUNCATE`. Triggers are often used for enforcing business rules, auditing changes, or maintaining data integrity.

```postgreSQL
-- Create a trigger function (this is a regular SQL function)
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION audit_trigger_function()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Perform actions such as logging changes
    INSERT INTO audit_log(table_name, action, timestamp)
    VALUES (TG_TABLE_NAME, TG_OP, now());

    -- Example of modifying data
    IF NEW.price < 0 THEN
        RAISE EXCEPTION 'Price cannot be negative!';
    END IF;

    -- Return NEW or NULL in case of AFTER trigger
    RETURN NEW; -- Return the modified row (NEW) after an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Create a trigger associated with a table
CREATE TRIGGER audit_trigger
AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON products
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION audit_trigger_function();
```

## Main Selling Points of Stored Procedures

By stating that a function can do the same thing as a stored procedure, let's outline the main selling points of stored procedures beyond the SQL standard and debunk some myths:

- **Supports Transactions**: Stored procedures can manage transactions, which can be essential for complex operations requiring consistency and rollback capabilities.
- **Centralized Logic**: Like functions, stored procedures centralize business logic within the database, making the application code agnostic. Fixing business logic in the stored procedures can be done at the database level without making

 new releases with fixes and patches.
- **Encapsulation of Sensitive Operations**: Stored procedures can encapsulate sensitive operations, reducing the exposure of the underlying data structures to direct manipulation by end-users or applications. You can assign execution rights on users and roles.
- **Precompiled and Cached**: It is often believed that stored procedures are precompiled and cached, providing performance benefits. This is a myth because:
    - All execution plans get cached for all SQL statements, whether in stored procedures or functions.
    - The main difference is that the database may inline the function body in the query itself, resulting in a different execution plan since functions can return values while stored procedures cannot.
- **Enhanced Performance**:
    - Minimizes round trips between the app and the database server, as the business logic is on the database server itself.
    - Sending fewer SQL statements over the network can reduce latency (e.g., calling a procedure instead of sending a 30-line SQL statement).
    - Ensures consistent SQL statement content, which avoids recomputation of execution plans. Differences in whitespace and formatting can lead to different execution plans being generated.

By understanding these points, you can make informed decisions about when to use stored procedures and functions based on your specific needs and performance considerations.
